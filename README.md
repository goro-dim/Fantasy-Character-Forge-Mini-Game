# Baldur’s Gate 3 Character Forge

*“Forge your fate, or at least laugh while you try.”*

Welcome to the **Baldur’s Gate 3 Character Forge**, a whimsical sandbox for dreamers, writers, and chaotic adventurers who can’t decide what to play next.

This isn’t your typical “Which class are you?” quiz. Instead, it’s a **branching character generator mini-game** that:

* Asks strange, story-driven questions
* Builds secret stat profiles based on your choices
* Mixes in randomness, quirks, and moral contradictions
* Then forges a rich, funny, and weirdly believable BG3 character

You might end up a *Halfling Warlock who fears geese*, a *Half-Elf Bard obsessed with chairs*, or a *Githyanki Monk with a secret love of poetry.* The Forge doesn’t judge — it just creates.

## How to Run

Interactive mode:

```bash
python3 character_generator.py
```

Or generate a few demo characters instantly:

```bash
python3 character_generator.py --demo
```

Optionally seed for repeatable results:

```bash
python3 character_generator.py --seed 42
```

## Features

* 18+ branching questions influencing 10 hidden stats
* Smart class/background matching (all BG3 base classes & archetypes)
* Random quirks, flaws, and “roleplay hooks”
* Lighthearted narration with occasional nonsense
* Terminal output that feels like a DM’s summary page

---

## Future Ideas

* **GUI version** with illustrated fantasy scenes, dice roll animations, and dynamic music
* Export to markdown or PDF “character sheets”
* “Party mode”: generate an entire band of misfits for a BG3 campaign
* Integration with your own world’s lore — turn it into a *writer’s tool*

## License & Inspiration

Free to use, remix, or expand.
Inspired by *Baldur’s Gate 3*, tabletop roleplaying chaos, and far too many character-creation screens.

### Remember

You can’t min-max destiny. But you can definitely make it weird.
